Integrating Apache ECharts with Angular 20: A Definitive Architectural and Implementation Guide


Section 1: Foundational Integration Strategies: A Comparative Analysis

The integration of a powerful, framework-agnostic data visualization library like Apache ECharts into a structured, component-based framework such as Angular presents a critical architectural decision. The choice of integration strategy profoundly impacts developer experience, application maintainability, performance, and adherence to framework-specific best practices. Two primary approaches exist: direct manual integration and the use of a dedicated wrapper library. This analysis will dissect both methods and provide a definitive recommendation for enterprise-grade Angular 20 applications.

1.1 The Direct Integration Approach: Manual Lifecycle Management

The most fundamental method for using ECharts in an Angular application involves treating it as any other third-party JavaScript library. This approach requires the developer to manually manage the entire lifecycle of the chart instance within an Angular component.
The implementation typically follows a set pattern. A placeholder <div> element is defined in the component's HTML template, which will serve as the container for the chart. In the component's TypeScript file, the developer uses the @ViewChild decorator to get a ElementRef to this container. The core of the logic resides in Angular's lifecycle hooks. The ngAfterViewInit hook is used to initialize the chart instance via the echarts.init() method, passing the native DOM element.1
This manual control extends to all aspects of the chart's existence. If the chart's configuration options need to be updated dynamically in response to input changes, the developer must implement the ngOnChanges hook, check for relevant changes, and manually call echartsInstance.setOption() to apply them. Critically, to prevent memory leaks and performance degradation, the developer is responsible for explicitly cleaning up the chart instance in the ngOnDestroy hook by calling echartsInstance.dispose().
While this method offers the advantage of having no dependencies beyond the core echarts library and provides direct, unfiltered access to its API, its drawbacks are significant. The code becomes verbose and imperative, forcing the developer to write boilerplate logic for initialization, updates, and destruction. This manual management is not only tedious but also error-prone, as forgetting to dispose of an instance can lead to persistent memory leaks. Most importantly, this approach runs counter to the declarative paradigm that is central to Angular's design, leading to a less maintainable and architecturally inconsistent codebase.

1.2 The Wrapper Library Approach: ngx-echarts

The community-standard and recommended approach is to utilize a dedicated wrapper library. For the Angular ecosystem, ngx-echarts is the most prominent and well-maintained option. This library provides an Angular directive that serves as a declarative bridge between the Angular component and the ECharts instance, abstracting away the complexities of manual lifecycle management.
With ngx-echarts, the implementation becomes remarkably clean and idiomatic to Angular. A developer simply adds the echarts directive to a div element and uses property binding to pass the configuration object: <div echarts [options]="chartOptions"></div>. The wrapper handles the rest. It automatically initializes the chart when the component is created, watches the [options] input for changes and intelligently calls setOption() to update the chart, and, crucially, disposes of the instance when the component is destroyed.
This declarative approach aligns perfectly with Angular's component-based architecture. It dramatically reduces boilerplate code, minimizes the risk of common errors like memory leaks, and provides a clean, Angular-native API through a set of directive inputs (e.g., [options], [merge], [theme]) and outputs (e.g., (chartInit), (chartClick)). The library is actively maintained, with specific versions released to ensure compatibility with major Angular updates, including Angular 20.2 The only minor drawback is the introduction of an additional third-party dependency, a negligible cost when weighed against the substantial benefits in productivity and code quality.

1.3 Architectural Recommendation and Rationale

The choice between these two methods is more than a matter of convenience; it represents a decision about architectural philosophy. ECharts, at its core, is a library that operates imperatively: it is given a DOM element and instructed to draw on it.1 Angular, conversely, is a declarative framework where the developer defines the desired state of the UI, and the framework manages the underlying DOM manipulation.
Direct integration forces a clash of these paradigms. The developer must embed imperative, low-level DOM management code within the declarative structure of an Angular component. This creates a "leaky abstraction" where the component is no longer a pure representation of its state but is also burdened with the manual mechanics of a third-party library's lifecycle.
The ngx-echarts wrapper resolves this conflict by acting as a crucial adapter. It encapsulates the imperative echarts.init(), setOption(), and dispose() calls, exposing a clean, declarative interface to the Angular developer. This allows the developer to work entirely within the Angular paradigm, binding data and configuration declaratively, while the wrapper handles the translation to the imperative commands that ECharts understands. This separation of concerns leads to code that is cleaner, easier to test, and significantly more maintainable in the long term.
For any professional, non-trivial application, ngx-echarts is unequivocally the "best way" to integrate Apache ECharts into an Angular project. The benefits of architectural consistency, reduced boilerplate, and improved maintainability far outweigh the cost of adding a single, well-supported dependency.

Section 2: Mastering ngx-echarts in an Angular 20 Environment

Successfully integrating ECharts with ngx-echarts in a modern Angular 20 project requires an understanding of modern Angular patterns, such as standalone components and tree-shaking, and leveraging the latest features of both Angular and the wrapper library, including zoneless compatibility.

2.1 Key Considerations for Angular 20: Granular Imports and Zoneless Compatibility

The evolution of ngx-echarts alongside Angular has introduced important patterns that are now standard practice for modern development.
Granular Imports: The Standard for Performance
A critical consideration for developers is the mandatory "Ã  la carte" import strategy that became standard with ngx-echarts v19.3 This approach, which requires developers to import only the necessary modules from ECharts, continues to be the required method for Angular 20. Any attempt to use a monolithic import will result in build errors. While this requires more specific import statements, it enforces a crucial performance best practice: tree-shaking. This ensures that only the code for the specific charts and components you use is included in the final application bundle, leading to smaller, faster-loading applications.
Zoneless Compatibility: The Future of Angular Performance
The headline feature for ngx-echarts v20.0.0 is its full compatibility with Angular's new zoneless applications.2 Angular 20 promotes zoneless to a developer preview, signaling a major shift in the framework's future.4 In a zoneless application, Angular removes the
Zone.js dependency, which was traditionally used to automatically trigger change detection in response to browser events.4 Instead, change detection relies on more explicit triggers, primarily the update of an Angular Signal.4
The ngx-echarts v20 library is built to work seamlessly in this new environment.2 This means developers can build more performant applications with simpler change detection logic, and
ngx-echarts will integrate perfectly without requiring Zone.js to be present. This alignment with modern Angular architecture makes ngx-echarts a forward-looking choice for new and existing projects.

2.2 Installation and Project Setup

The installation process is straightforward but requires attention to version compatibility.
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Using NPM or Yarn, install the core echarts library first, followed by the specific version of ngx-echarts compatible with Angular 20.
Using NPM:

Bash


npm install echarts --save
npm install ngx-echarts@20.0.0 --save


Using Yarn:

Bash


yarn add echarts
yarn add ngx-echarts@20.0.0


Step 2: Verify Versions
After installation, it is crucial to inspect the project's package.json file. Ensure that the version for ngx-echarts is ~20.0.0 or a subsequent compatible version.2 This guarantees that you are using the release specifically built and tested for the Angular 20 environment, including its zoneless capabilities.

2.3 Modern Implementation: Standalone Components (Recommended)

For new Angular applications or those embracing modern patterns, using standalone components is the preferred approach. It enhances encapsulation, optimizes tree-shaking, and is the ideal pattern for zoneless applications.
Implementation Guide:
Component File (bar-chart.component.ts): Granularly import only the required modules from echarts and ngx-echarts.
Register Modules: Call echarts.use() to register the imported ECharts components.
Component Decorator: In the @Component decorator, add NgxEchartsDirective to the imports array to make the directive available in the template. Add provideEchartsCore({ echarts }) to the providers array to supply the ECharts instance to the directive.2
Example Component TypeScript:

TypeScript


import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

// Step 1: Import the `ngx-echarts` directive and the core provider
import { NgxEchartsDirective, provideEchartsCore } from 'ngx-echarts';

// Step 2: Import the ECharts core and the required components
import * as echarts from 'echarts/core';
import { BarChart } from 'echarts/charts';
import {
  TitleComponent,
  TooltipComponent,
  GridComponent,
  LegendComponent
} from 'echarts/components';
import { CanvasRenderer } from 'echarts/renderers';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-bar-chart',
  standalone: true,
  // Step 3: Add NgxEchartsDirective to the component's imports
  imports:,
  templateUrl: './bar-chart.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./bar-chart.component.css'],
  // Step 4: Provide the ECharts core to the directive
  providers: [
    provideEchartsCore({
      echarts
    })
  ]
})
export class BarChartComponent {
  // Step 5: Define the chart options object
  chartOption = {
    title: { text: 'Sample Bar Chart' },
    tooltip: {},
    legend: { data: },
    xAxis: {
      data:
    },
    yAxis: {},
    series:
    }]
  };

  constructor() {
    // Step 6: Register the required ECharts components
    echarts.use();
  }
}


Example Component Template (bar-chart.component.html):

HTML


<div echarts [options]="chartOption" style="height: 400px;"></div>



2.4 Legacy and Mixed-Mode Implementation: NgModules

For projects still using the NgModule architecture, the setup is centralized in the module file.
Implementation Guide:
Module File (app.module.ts): Import the required ECharts modules and register them using echarts.use().
Import NgxEchartsModule: Import the module from the ngx-echarts library.
@NgModule Decorator: In the imports array, add NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({ echarts }). This provides the ECharts instance to the entire module scope.
Example Module (app.module.ts):

TypeScript


import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Step 1: Import NgxEchartsModule
import { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';

// Step 2: Import ECharts core and required components
import * as echarts from 'echarts/core';
import { BarChart } from 'echarts/charts';
import { TitleComponent, TooltipComponent, GridComponent } from 'echarts/components';
import { CanvasRenderer } from 'echarts/renderers';

// Step 3: Register the components
echarts.use();

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports:,
  providers:,
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }


The component's TypeScript and template would then be simpler, containing only the chartOption definition and the div element, as the imports and providers are handled at the module level.

Section 3: The ngx-echarts Directive: A Deep Dive into the API

The power of ngx-echarts lies in its directive, which exposes a rich, declarative API for controlling the chart. Understanding this API is key to moving beyond basic charts to create dynamic, interactive, and performant visualizations.

3.1 Directive Inputs and Outputs: The Declarative Interface

The directive's API is primarily composed of input properties for configuration and output events for interactivity.
Key Inputs:
[options] (object): This is the most fundamental input. It accepts the standard ECharts option object that defines the chart's appearance, data, and behavior.
[merge] (object): A critical performance optimization tool. When you need to update only a part of the chart, such as the data in a series, binding to [merge] instead of [options] tells ECharts to merge the new data into the existing configuration rather than re-rendering the entire chart from scratch. This is significantly faster for real-time data updates.
[loading] (boolean): A declarative way to toggle the built-in ECharts loading animation. Setting [loading]="true" will show the spinner, which is ideal when fetching data asynchronously.
[theme] (string | object): Applies a pre-registered theme to the chart. You can pass a theme name (e.g., 'dark') or a full theme configuration object.
[initOpts] (object): An object passed directly to the echarts.init() function during initialization. This is used for setting foundational options like the renderer ('canvas' or 'svg') or the device pixel ratio.
`` (boolean): Defaults to true. When enabled, the directive automatically listens for window resize events and calls the chart's resize() method to ensure it remains responsive.
Key Outputs:
(chartInit) (event): This event fires once the ECharts instance has been successfully initialized, emitting the instance object itself. This is the "escape hatch" for accessing the native ECharts API.
(chartClick), (chartDblClick), (chartMouseOver), etc. (event): ngx-echarts provides a comprehensive set of event outputs that correspond directly to the mouse events supported by ECharts. They are prefixed with chart (e.g., click becomes chartClick). This makes it trivial to bind chart interactions to methods in your Angular component.

3.2 Advanced Control: Accessing the Core ECharts Instance

While ngx-echarts promotes a declarative style, it does not lock the developer out of the underlying library's full capabilities. There are scenarios where direct, imperative control is necessary, such as programmatically dispatching actions (e.g., highlighting a series) or calling specific API methods.
The (chartInit) output provides the perfect mechanism for this. By binding to this event, a developer can get a reference to the live ECharts instance and store it in their component.
The (chartInit) Pattern:
Template Binding: In the component's HTML, bind the (chartInit) output to a component method.
HTML
<div echarts 
     [options]="chartOptions" 
     (chartInit)="onChartInit($event)">
</div>


Component Logic: In the component's TypeScript, define the handler method and store the emitted instance.
TypeScript
import { ECharts } from 'echarts/core';

export class MyChartComponent {
  echartsInstance: ECharts;

  onChartInit(ec: ECharts) {
    this.echartsInstance = ec;
  }

  // Example method to programmatically resize the chart
  resizeChart() {
    if (this.echartsInstance) {
      this.echartsInstance.resize();
    }
  }

  // Example method to show the loading animation imperatively
  showLoadingAnimation() {
    if (this.echartsInstance) {
      this.echartsInstance.showLoading();
    }
  }
}


This pattern strikes an ideal balance. It allows developers to handle the vast majority of use cases declaratively while providing a clean, explicit "escape hatch" to the full imperative power of the ECharts API when needed. This ensures the wrapper enhances productivity without ever becoming a limitation.

Section 4: Enterprise-Grade Concerns: Performance and Optimization

For enterprise applications, performance is not an afterthought but a core requirement. In the context of a charting library, "performance" is a multifaceted concept that must be addressed holistically. A truly optimized implementation considers three distinct pillars: Load Performance (the initial bundle size and page load time), Render Performance (the efficiency of drawing the chart, especially with large datasets), and Perceived Performance (how responsive the application feels to the user during interactions).

4.1 The Art of Tree-Shaking: A Practical Guide to Minimizing Bundle Size

This section focuses on Load Performance. The single most effective technique for reducing the impact of ECharts on your application's initial load time is tree-shaking. The full, un-treeshaken ECharts library can add over 1MB of uncompressed JavaScript to your bundle, which is unacceptable for production applications. As established, the mandatory import changes in ngx-echarts now force this practice, but understanding how to implement it correctly is vital.
The goal is to instruct the Angular CLI's build optimizer to include only the code for the specific charts, components, and renderers your application actually uses, discarding everything else.
Practical Implementation:
Consider creating a simple bar chart. A non-optimized approach might have hypothetically imported everything. The correct, tree-shaken approach is surgical.
Required Imports for a Basic Bar Chart:

TypeScript


// Core ECharts functionality
import * as echarts from 'echarts/core';

// Specific chart type(s)
import { BarChart } from 'echarts/charts';

// Required components for the chart
import {
  TitleComponent,
  TooltipComponent,
  GridComponent
} from 'echarts/components';

// A renderer (Canvas is generally more performant for large data)
import { CanvasRenderer } from 'echarts/renderers';


Registration:
These imported modules must then be explicitly registered with the ECharts core.

TypeScript


echarts.use();


This pattern ensures that code for pie charts, radar charts, maps, the SVG renderer, and other unused components is completely eliminated from the final production bundle, leading to a dramatic reduction in size and a significantly faster initial load.

4.2 Achieving Full Type Safety with ComposeOption

A subtle but critical consequence of granular imports is the loss of TypeScript's type safety. The default EChartsOption type provided by the library assumes all components are available. When you only import a subset, this default type becomes inaccurate, and TypeScript can no longer catch configuration errors at compile time.
The solution is to use the ComposeOption utility type provided by ECharts to construct a new, precise option type that reflects only the modules you have imported.
Implementation Guide:
Import Specific Option Types: Alongside the components, import their corresponding option types.
Import Core Types: Import EChartsCoreOption and ComposeOption.
Construct Custom Type: Combine the core type with the specific option types.
Apply the Type: Use this new custom type for your component's options property.
Example:

TypeScript


// Import component and series option types
import { BarSeriesOption } from 'echarts/charts';
import {
  TitleComponentOption,
  TooltipComponentOption,
  GridComponentOption
} from 'echarts/components';
import { EChartsCoreOption, ComposeOption } from 'echarts/core';

// Construct a precise, composed option type
type MyBarChartOption = ComposeOption<
| BarSeriesOption
| TitleComponentOption
| TooltipComponentOption
| GridComponentOption
>;

// In your component:
export class BarChartComponent {
  // Use the custom type for full type safety
  chartOption: MyBarChartOption = {
    //... your chart configuration
  };
}


This restores and enhances type safety, allowing the TypeScript compiler to validate your chart configuration and flag errors, such as attempting to use a dataZoom property without having imported DataZoomComponentOption. This is a hallmark of a robust, professional implementation.

4.3 High-Performance Charting with Large Datasets

This section addresses Render Performance. While ECharts is highly optimized, rendering massive datasets requires leveraging its specialized features.
Large Data Rendering Mode: For scatter and graph charts with tens of thousands of points, setting series.large = true and configuring series.largeThreshold enables a more performant drawing mode that sacrifices some graphical detail for speed.
Progressive Rendering: To prevent the UI from freezing during the initial render of a very large chart, the series.progressive and series.progressiveThreshold properties can be used. This renders the chart in chunks, keeping the application responsive.
WebGL-Accelerated Rendering: For the most demanding scatter plot scenarios with hundreds of thousands or millions of points, the standard Canvas renderer is insufficient. The solution is to install the echarts-gl extension (npm install echarts-gl --save) and use the scatterGL series type. This leverages WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering, enabling performance levels that are impossible with 2D Canvas alone.
Efficient Data Structures: ECharts natively supports TypedArray for data series. For large numerical datasets, using a Float32Array or Int32Array instead of a standard JavaScript array can reduce memory consumption and improve performance due to more efficient garbage collection.

4.4 Verifying Optimizations and Preventing Regressions

Optimizations are meaningless without verification. Two key practices ensure that performance gains are real and lasting.
Bundle Analysis: To visually confirm that tree-shaking is working as expected, use a tool like webpack-bundle-analyzer. It can be integrated into an Angular project by adding a script to package.json. Running this analysis after a production build (ng build --stats-json) generates an interactive treemap of your bundle, clearly showing the size of each dependency. This allows you to verify that unused ECharts modules have been successfully eliminated.
Performance Budgets: The Angular CLI provides a powerful mechanism for preventing performance regressions. In the angular.json file, you can define "budgets" that set size thresholds for your application's bundles. If a code change or new dependency causes a bundle to exceed its warning or error threshold, the build process will alert you or fail entirely. This is an invaluable tool for continuous integration environments, ensuring that performance regressions are caught before they reach production.
By addressing load, render, and perceived performance, developers can deliver an experience that is not only visually rich but also fast and responsive, meeting the high standards of modern enterprise applications.

Section 5: Troubleshooting and Ecosystem Context

Even with a robust integration strategy, developers may encounter specific issues, particularly with new framework versions. This section provides solutions to common problems in the Angular 20 and ngx-echarts ecosystem and situates ECharts within the broader landscape of Angular charting libraries.

5.1 Common Pitfalls and Solutions in Angular 20 Integration

Problem 1: TypeScript Type Errors for Shared Options
Symptom: When using granular imports, developers often find that common type definitions like SeriesOption, LineSeriesOption, or YAXisComponentOption are not exported from the primary echarts/core or echarts/charts entry points, leading to TypeScript errors.
Root Cause: The tree-shaking-friendly architecture of ECharts v5 places these shared type definitions in a separate, deep path within the package.
Solution: These types must be imported directly from their specific location. A critical GitHub issue thread confirms the correct import path.6
TypeScript
import type { SeriesOption } from 'echarts/types/dist/shared';
Explicitly providing this solution prevents developer frustration and lengthy debugging sessions.
Problem 2: "Property 'series' comes from an index signature" Error
Symptom: A common TypeScript error that occurs when trying to access properties like series on a chart options object (e.g., this.chartOption.series).
Root Cause: This error arises when the chartOption object is loosely typed (e.g., as any or a generic object) and the TypeScript compiler cannot guarantee the existence of the property. It is a direct side effect of not implementing the strongly-typed ComposeOption pattern discussed in Section 4.2.6
Solution: The architecturally correct and recommended solution is to adopt the ComposeOption pattern to create a precise type for your chart options. This provides full type safety and eliminates the error. A less ideal, temporary workaround is to use bracket notation (this.chartOption['series']) to bypass the TypeScript check, but this sacrifices type safety and should be avoided in production code.
Problem 3: Chart Not Rendering in a Hidden Container
Symptom: An ECharts instance fails to initialize or renders with zero width and height if its container div has display: none or is otherwise hidden from the DOM layout at the moment of initialization.
Root Cause: ECharts relies on the browser's layout engine to determine the dimensions of its container. If the container is not in the layout, its dimensions are zero, and the chart cannot be drawn.7
Solution: The official ECharts API documentation provides the solution. The developer must trigger a resize after the container becomes visible.7 The
(chartInit) pattern from Section 3.2 is perfect for this. Store the ECharts instance, and when the logic to show the container is executed, immediately call this.echartsInstance.resize(). This will force the chart to re-measure its container and render correctly.

5.2 A Note on Alternative Libraries

While this report focuses on ECharts, understanding its place in the ecosystem provides valuable context. A developer's choice of library is often guided by the specific needs of the project.
ngx-charts: This is another highly popular library in the Angular community. Its key architectural difference is that it is a "native" Angular charting library. It uses the powerful D3.js library for mathematical calculations (scales, axes, shapes) but leverages Angular's own rendering engine to create and animate the SVG elements.8 This is fundamentally different from
ngx-echarts, which is a wrapper around the complete, self-contained ECharts rendering engine. ngx-charts can feel more integrated with Angular's change detection but may not have the sheer breadth of chart types and advanced features that ECharts provides out of the box.
Chart.js (via ng2-charts): Chart.js is often chosen for its simplicity, ease of use, and small bundle size.9 It is an excellent choice for projects with relatively basic charting requirements, such as simple bar, line, and pie charts. When the advanced customization, rich interactivity, and extensive chart portfolio of ECharts are not necessary, Chart.js can be a more lightweight and faster alternative to integrate.
Ultimately, the decision to use Apache ECharts is a decision to prioritize power, customizability, and a vast feature set. For a developer who has already made that choice, ngx-echarts stands as the premier integration method, successfully marrying the immense capabilities of the ECharts engine with the declarative, component-driven architecture of Angular.

Conclusion and Best Practices Checklist

The optimal strategy for integrating Apache ECharts into an Angular 20 application is clear and definitive. The use of the ngx-echarts wrapper library is the superior approach, providing an architecturally sound, declarative, and maintainable solution that aligns with modern Angular principles. The direct manual integration method, while functional, introduces unnecessary complexity and runs counter to the framework's design, making it unsuitable for professional development.
The release of ngx-echarts v20 for Angular 20 continues the best practice of mandatory granular imports, ensuring optimized bundles by default. More importantly, it introduces full compatibility with Angular's forward-looking zoneless architecture, allowing for more performant applications with simplified change detection.2 To manage the complexity of this new import strategy while maintaining code quality, developers must leverage the
ComposeOption utility to ensure full TypeScript type safety for their chart configurations.
For enterprise-grade applications, a holistic view of performance is essential, encompassing not just the initial load time but also the runtime rendering performance with large datasets and the perceived performance from the user's perspective. By utilizing ECharts' advanced rendering features, analyzing bundle composition, and setting performance budgets, teams can build and maintain highly performant data visualizations.
The following checklist summarizes the key recommendations for a successful and optimized integration:
[â] Choose the Right Tool: Use the ngx-echarts library for integration. Avoid direct manual lifecycle management.
[â] Ensure Version Compatibility: Install echarts and the correct version of ngx-echarts for your Angular version (ngx-echarts@^20.0.0 for Angular 20).2
[â] Embrace Granular Imports: Import only the specific chart types, components, and renderers required for each chart from their respective entry points (e.g., echarts/core, echarts/charts).
[â] Register All Modules: Ensure every imported module is registered via echarts.use([...]).
[â] Prioritize Standalone Components: Use the standalone component pattern with NgxEchartsDirective in imports and provideEchartsCore in providers for modern applications.
[â] Leverage Zoneless Compatibility: For new projects or those migrating, adopt Angular's zoneless mode for a more performant application, knowing ngx-echarts is fully compatible.2
[â] Guarantee Type Safety: Construct a custom, precise option type using ComposeOption to enable compile-time error checking.
[â] Optimize Updates: Use the [merge] input for dynamic data updates to avoid costly full re-renders.
[â] Leverage the Escape Hatch: Use the (chartInit) output to gain access to the native ECharts instance for advanced, imperative operations when necessary.
[â] Verify Bundle Size: Use a tool like webpack-bundle-analyzer to confirm that tree-shaking is effectively removing unused ECharts code.
[â] Prevent Regressions: Configure performance budgets in angular.json to enforce bundle size limits in your CI/CD pipeline.
