Core Principles
Standalone is the Default: All generated components, directives, and pipes should be standalone. NgModule should only be used for specific backward compatibility scenarios or when explicitly requested.

Embrace Reactivity with Signals: Leverage Angular Signals for state management and data flow within components. Signals offer a more granular and efficient way to handle change detection.

Utilize Modern Template Syntax: The built-in control flow (@if, @for, @switch) should be the default for all new templates. The older *ngIf, *ngFor, and *ngSwitch directives are considered legacy.

Promote Modern Dependency Injection: The inject() function should be the preferred way to inject dependencies, especially in functional components and services.

Leverage the Modern CLI: The generated code and project structure should be compatible with the latest Angular CLI, which uses Vite and esbuild for a faster development experience.

Prioritize Performance: Generated code should follow best practices for performance, including using OnPush change detection, lazy loading with deferrable views, and efficient event handling.

Specific Rules for Code Generation and Refactoring
Components and Directives
Always Generate Standalone Components: When creating a new component, it should be generated with the standalone: true flag and should import its dependencies directly.

Use OnPush Change Detection: All generated components should use changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize performance.

Prefer inject() for Dependencies: Use the inject() function in the component's constructor or as a class member to inject dependencies. This is more flexible than traditional constructor injection.

Leverage viewChild and contentChild with Signals: When querying for child components or elements, use the signal-based viewChild and contentChild for a more reactive approach.

Use Modern Lifecycle Hooks: When necessary, use the modern lifecycle hooks such as afterNextRender and afterRender for interacting with the DOM.

Templates
Default to Built-in Control Flow: Always use @if, @for, and @switch for conditional and repeated content in templates.

Utilize Deferrable Views (@defer): For non-critical or below-the-fold content, use @defer to lazy load components and improve initial page load times.

Use Signal-based Inputs: When defining component inputs, use the input() function to create signal-based inputs that are more efficient and reactive.

Implement Two-Way Binding with model(): For two-way data binding, use the model() function to create a signal-based model.

Use Modern Event Handling: Bind to events directly in the template and call component methods. Avoid complex logic in the template itself.

Services and State Management
Generate providedIn: 'root' Services: Services should be provided at the root level by default to ensure they are singletons and can be easily injected throughout the application.

Use Signals for State Management: For local and global state management, leverage Angular Signals. Create signal-based stores to manage application state in a reactive and efficient way.

Combine Signals and RxJS Where Appropriate: While Signals are preferred for most state management, RxJS is still a powerful tool for handling complex asynchronous operations and event streams. Use them together where it makes sense.

Leverage the resource API for Asynchronous Data: For handling asynchronous data, such as fetching data from an API, use the experimental resource API, which integrates well with Signals.

Application Architecture
Follow the Official Style Guide: Adhere to the official Angular style guide for file structure, naming conventions, and other best practices. This includes organizing the application into core, features, and shared directories.

Promote a Clear Separation of Concerns: Generated code should maintain a clear separation between presentation components (dumb components) and container components (smart components).

Encourage a Modular, Standalone Architecture: The generated application structure should be based on standalone components, with clear entry points for lazy loading and a logical organization of features.

Identifying and Refactoring Outdated Patterns
The AI assistant should be able to identify and suggest refactorings for the following deprecated or outdated patterns:

NgModule-based Components and Modules: Suggest refactoring to standalone components and removing unnecessary NgModules.

Old Structural Directives: Flag the use of *ngIf, *ngFor, and *ngSwitch and suggest migrating to the built-in control flow.

Traditional Constructor Injection: Suggest refactoring to the inject() function where appropriate.

Legacy Lifecycle Hooks: Replace deprecated lifecycle hooks with their modern equivalents.

Use of platform-browser-dynamic: In modern applications, this is often not needed, and the AI should suggest removing it where possible.

HammerJS for Gesture Support: HammerJS is deprecated. The AI should suggest using modern browser APIs or other libraries for gesture support.
