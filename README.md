# DevOps Setup with Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version ^18.19.1 || ^20.11.1 || >=22.0.0)
- npm (latest version recommended)
- Angular CLI v19

### Installation Steps

1. Install Angular CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. Project was created with:
   ```bash
   ng new devops-setup --directory . --strict
   ```
   - Using strict mode for better type safety
   - Using standalone components (default in Angular 19)
   - CSS for styling
   - No SSR/SSG setup
