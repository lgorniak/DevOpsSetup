# DevOpsSetup
Research-driven Angular project setup focused on discovering the best tools and practices for scalable architecture, CI/CD, automated testing, and developer productivity. A living project exploring modern workflows and configurations.

🔍 Project Goal
To identify and document the most effective technologies, patterns, and workflows for:

Scalable Angular architecture

CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)

Code quality enforcement (linting, formatting, type checking)

Deployment strategies and tooling

Developer productivity (monorepos, scaffolding tools, etc.)
  
  🧪 In Progress
  This is an experimental setup — ideal tools and configurations will be tested, benchmarked, and iteratively improved over time.
